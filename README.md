# Cloud Resume Challenge

I am currently working on the **Cloud Resume Challenge** using the following AWS services:

- **S3**: For hosting my static website.
- **CloudFront**: To deliver my website securely and quickly with caching.
- **DynamoDB**: To store and update the visitor count.
- **Lambda**: To handle backend logic for updating the visitor count in DynamoDB.
- **API Gateway**: To connect the frontend and backend securely.
- **Route 53**: To manage the DNS for my custom domain.
- **GitHub Actions**: To implement CI/CD for my project, ensuring efficient updates and deployment.

## Future Projects

After completing this challenge, I plan to start a project on **Azure** to expand my cloud and DevSecOps expertise. I am open to recommendations for Azure-based projects that can help solidify my understanding of Azure services.
